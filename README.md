<h2><b>Stocks App</b></h2>
This app is essentially a project that was started in order to learn more about what goes into making apps like these. Right now it can search for a stock that you are interested in and then you can select the amount of stocks you want to purchase and the purchase price you bought the stocks at. You can then add the stock and it will show up on your homepage. 

<h2><b>Tech</b></h2>
I used React Native as the framework to make this app because of its ability to work on both IOS and Android out of the box without too much extra configuration. The backend I chose for this project was Django and the stock infromation I was pulling was from the finnhub api.

<h2><b>Current Status</b></h2>
This project is at its very earliest stages. There is a lot more I would like to add to the app such as being able to add freinds and have competitions with each other over who can get the highest gains from the stocks you have added to your profile. Other updates would be adding the things you would typically see in your average stock app such as percenatge gained from the stock you bought and the total amount of money you would have invested.
